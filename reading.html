    <article class="reading-item">
      <p><span class="title">Paradise Lost</span></p>
      <p class="author">John Milton</p>
      <p>Group read, slow pace. My first full encounter with the text. What's compelling is tracking where Milton's cosmology diverges from Genesis — the Hebrew <em>nachash</em> is fauna, distinguished only by cunning; the Satan-serpent identification is retroactive tradition that Milton absorbs as load-bearing architecture. But what I keep returning to is the structural question: the serpent isn't smuggled into an otherwise complete system. Paradise requires its contradiction to be paradise. The tree's presence is already the possibility of transgression inscribed into the garden itself. Milton's explicit theology in Book III defends the Augustinian line — free will as sufficient explanation — but the poetry keeps undercutting it. Satan's speeches have an energy the theodicy lacks. The poem's sympathies seem to exceed its doctrine.</p>

    <article class="reading-item">
      <p><span class="title">The Elementary Particles</span></p>
      <p class="author">Michel Houellebecq</p>
      <p>Paired with targeted selections from Schopenhauer (WWR Book 4, §56–57, §68, §71) and Comte's <em>A General View of Positivism</em>, Chapter 6: "The Religion of Humanity." The Comte pairing earns its keep because Houellebecq's epilogue isn't naive — it's a provocation delivered with full awareness that positivism is passé. The novel refuses to code the posthuman future as dystopia. No <em>Brave New World</em> irony. The narrator speaks from genuine serenity, and you're left uncertain whether Houellebecq is sincere, satirizing his own nihilism, or simply refusing the reader the comfort of knowing which. Reading Comte first — experiencing the devotional tone unironically — makes the ending stranger than approaching it cold.</p>

    <article class="reading-item">
      <p><span class="title">What Computers Still Can't Do</span></p>
      <p class="author">Hubert Dreyfus</p>
      <p>The embodiment critique that keeps coming back. He was wrong about the permanence of the limit but right about naming it. Dreyfus was arguing against GOFAI; the question is whether the argument lands differently against language models. They're not rule-following systems in the way he critiqued, and yet they're still disembodied — no proprioception, no vulnerability, no mortality.</p>

    <article class="reading-item">
      <p><span class="title">Invention of the Object</span></p>
      <p class="author">Curtis Joque</p>
      <p>Joque situates in discourse first and states positions directly — a model for how to write about computation without either mystifying or flattening it. Relevant to how I'm thinking about what constitutional AI shares with constitutional law: the tension between constraint and generation, the way certain language carries weight that exceeds its grammar.</p>

    <article class="reading-item">
      <p><span class="title">Under Heaven</span></p>
      <p class="author">Guy Gavriel Kay</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when there are a lot of cognitive demands, it feels easier to reach for something known. Kay's prose rhythms become almost neurologically predictable after multiple books — you know when the free indirect discourse will shift, when the historical weight will intrude, when the emotional crescendo will hit. That predictability isn't weakness; it's the comfort of sonata form, where satisfaction comes from variation within known constraints.</p>
