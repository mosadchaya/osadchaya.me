    <h1>Preoccupations</h1>

    <h2>Solo motorcycle trips</h2>
    <img src="assets/motorcycle-cambodia.jpg" alt="Shadow of a motorcycle on a Cambodian rice paddy at golden hour" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <p>Sometimes, I like to take a pause in my life by going on solo motorcycle trips: Morocco, Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan, India, and other places. Closer to Shklovsky's ostranenie than to adventure travel—defamiliarization as a technique for recovering perception, except applied to yourself rather than a text. Nothing is automatic (and that's what I'm looking for!): navigation, language, social interaction, where to eat. The cognitive surplus that usually goes to routine becomes available for noticing. I read and write differently in these conditions, though I'm wary of romanticizing the there-ness of other places as though it were their property rather than a function of my own estrangement.</p>

    <h2>Multi-agent information hazards</h2>
    <p>What I call the "Orchestra Problem": individually safe AI agents producing collectively dangerous outcomes. You can audit each instrument exhaustively and still miss the catastrophic interaction. The detection problem is architectural, not behavioral—it requires monitoring the emergent properties of agent ensembles, not just the outputs of individual models.</p>

    <h2>Speech acts and negative space topology</h2>
    <p>What does it mean for an utterance to <em>do</em> something when there's no intending subject behind it? The Searle-Derrida debate assumed human speakers. Language models break that assumption without resolving it. I'm interested in treating meaning as topological—the shape of the space an utterance opens or forecloses—rather than semantic.</p>

    <h2>Constitutional AI and state-building</h2>
    <p>Anthropic's finding that general constitutional language shapes model behavior more effectively than prescriptive rules mirrors something I've observed in actual constitutions. Both serve as limit and generative push simultaneously. Why do AI models, like states, develop emergent forms that exceed the concrete language of their founding documents?</p>

    <h2>Alternatives to RLHF</h2>
    <p>RLHF is a noisy signal—a fairly naive approximation of preference building, much like early Skinnerian conditioning is a naive approximation of human behavior. Neuroevolution, decision transformers, and imitation learning remain underdeveloped as methodologies for directing model behavior. The shortcut is useful but shouldn't be mistaken for a complete theory of value alignment.</p>

    <h2>Embodiment and the Dreyfus critique</h2>
    <p>Dreyfus argued that intelligence requires embodied situatedness—being-in-the-world in the phenomenological sense. I don't accept this as an unbreachable limit, but it names an important current constraint. Where does language lack the explanatory power that physical experience can provide? The enactivist tradition (Varela, Thompson, Rosch) and Andy Clark's extended mind work are on the reading list.</p>

    <h2>Bread</h2>
    <p>Sourdough fermentation as a system with emergent properties. The starter is a multi-agent environment; temperature, hydration, and timing are the constitutional constraints. Sometimes the best explanation for why a loaf failed is that your model's topology was wrong.</p>
